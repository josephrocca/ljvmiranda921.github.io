<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have been blogging for **five years** now
ðŸŽ‰ It still feels like yesterday when I first published my ["Hello
World"](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) blogpost. Cumulatively, I've written
around **124,389 words** in **79 posts**, all done in **492 commits**!  Happy
that I kept at it for the past few years.

Blogging has always been part of my programming life, especially that of my
professional career&mdash; they're like siblings growing up together. I
published ["Hello World"](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) at the same time I
wrote [Pyswarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) in 2017. A year
later, I landed my first programming job. 

However, my first *actual* programming project was back in 2008, still in high
school, when I wrote **a simple [CRUD
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) for
student records.**

Yup, you read that right! For a final project that allowed us to do anything, I
decided to create a CRUD app. I don't remember why, I guess it was cool back
then?

Perhaps the pre-teen me thinks that "making games is for kids, CRUD apps are
for the real bois." I guess there was also a desire to be taken seriously,
especially when you're a kid, so you try your best to make "serious" stuff.
Funny how it's almost the reverse now&mdash; I enjoy [making
games](/projects/2021/08/15/abyss/) and [incorporating
play](/life/2021/09/21/build-earn-play/) into my craft.

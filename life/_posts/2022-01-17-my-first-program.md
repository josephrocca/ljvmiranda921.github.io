<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> have been blogging for **five years** now
ðŸŽ‰ It still feels like yesterday when I first published my ["Hello
World"](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) blogpost. Cumulatively, I've written
around **124,389 words** in **79 posts**, all done in **492 commits**!  Happy
that I kept at it for the past few years.

Blogging has always been part of my programming life, especially that of my
professional career&mdash; they're like siblings growing up together. I
published ["Hello World"](/life/2017/01/16/hello-world/) at the same time I
wrote [Pyswarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) in 2017.[^1] A year
later, I landed [my first programming job](https://thinkingmachin.es). 

However, my first *actual* programming project was back in 2008, still in high
school, when I wrote **a simple [CRUD
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) for
student records.**

Yup, you read that right! For a final project that allowed us to do anything, I
decided to create a CRUD app. I don't remember why, I guess it was cool back
then?

Perhaps the pre-teen me thinks that "making games is for kids, CRUD apps are
for the real bois." I guess there was also a desire to be taken seriously,
especially as a kid, so you try your best to make "serious" stuff.  Funny how
it's almost the reverse now&mdash; I enjoy [making
games](/projects/2021/08/15/abyss/) and [incorporating
play](/life/2021/09/21/build-earn-play/) into my craft.

Read on as I talk about my attempts to resurrect the project, pick apart my
code, and see all the fun tidbits that I inserted here and there!

## Resurrecting an old project

During my sabbatical last year, I managed to find the source code of my first
project. It was hidden in my closet, stored in a 2GB USB storage device. I
booted it up, and all my files are there:

<!-- show directory screenshot -->

It was written in [Visual Basic 6.0
(VB6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)), the predecessor
for [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET). Back then, Visual
Basic (VB) was still weird for me because in our school's computer lab, I open
it in its own IDE, but in my home PC, I can open it via Excel. *Weird*. Upon writing
this is when I learned that the latter is called [Visual Basic for Applications
(VBA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications). They're
the [same language](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd361851.aspx), but
on [different
environments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/993300/difference-between-visual-basic-6-0-and-vba).

<!-- screenshot of what VB 6 looks like -->

Now, they say that VB6 is already considered legacy since 2008[^2], so I guess
there's no way to run my project unless I have an official copy of Windows.
But VBA is still alive. Heck, it was even the [most dreaded
language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) last year (second
only to COBOL), so there's still a fighting chance.

Good thing, 

## Diving into the source


## Fun tidbits


## Epilogue


**So what happened between 2008 to 2017?** Well, a lot of things. During my
last two years of high school, I didn't choose a tech-related[^3] 
elective and opted for journalism. There's a fascination with code, of course,
but they're still seeds freshly sowed. 

In undergrad, I learned how to write C, C++, and Assembly for our
microelectronics classes. Then by fourth year I learned to write MATLAB.
There's no spark yet, just seeds germinating as they get watered by my coding
experiences. There's no [craftsmanship](/life/2019/10/15/on-craftsmanship/)
yet, just writing code to get the job done. 

**And now we're back to 2017**, a pivotal moment in my programming life. I
[setup my
blog](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/ljvmiranda921.github.io/commit/5a107a575601952a5cbfea964cf9a23346b7fd20)
and published my [first PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/pyswarms/), *you
know the rest*. The last five years were awesome: I learned a lot about my
craft, and even now I'm still relearning what it means to build things.
Needless to say, I'm excited for the next five years, and the next five years
after that, and the five years thereafter! Thank you, reader, for following me
in this journey.










### Footnotes

[^1]: Yeah, just a one-year gap. Doing open-source has accelerated my learning. Sure, I knew how to program, but it's different when you're writing production code. I'm happy that I'm doing open-source and research full time now.
[^2]: Wait, does that mean I'm learning a language already deemed legacy back in '08? That's funny!
[^3]: I think back then we had a choice between electronics, robotics, and programming.
